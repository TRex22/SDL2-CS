{"name":"SDL2-CS","tagline":"SDL2# - C# Wrapper for SDL2","body":"SDL2#\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThis is a fork of SDL2#, a C# wrapper for SDL2.\r\nThis fork will probably only be updated with revisions I need for my projects.\r\nThe fork is maintained by (@TRex22). \r\n\r\nProject Website: https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nSDL2 and SDL2# are released under the zlib license. See LICENSE for details.\r\n\r\nSDL2# currently uses parts of OpenTK, which is released under the MIT license.\r\nSee opentk.LICENSE for details.\r\n\r\nAbout SDL2\r\n----------\r\nFor more information about SDL2, visit the SDL wiki:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.fcg/FrontPage\r\n\r\nAbout the C# Wrapper\r\n--------------------\r\nThe C# wrapper was written to be used for MonoGame's desktop platforms. However,\r\nthis is written in a way that can be used for any general C# application.\r\n\r\nThe wrapper provides bindings for the following libraries:\r\n- SDL2\r\n- SDL2_image\r\n- SDL2_mixer\r\n- SDL2_ttf\r\n\r\nWe also provide bindings for OpenGL and OpenAL, taken from OpenTK.\r\n\r\nNote that SDL2# will not provide every single SDL2 function. This is due to\r\nlimitations in the C# language that would cause major conflicts with the native\r\nSDL2 library and its extensions.\r\n\r\nSDL2# is a pure port of the C headers. The naming schemes for this library will\r\nbe exactly as they are done in the C library, with little-to-no concern for\r\n\"appropriate\" C# style. The namespace indicates that this is SDL2, the class\r\nnames will indicate which library file the function/type/value exists in, and\r\neverything else will be as close to the C version as technically possible.\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\nTo see the current roadmap for SDL2#, visit the GitHub issues page:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS/issues\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
